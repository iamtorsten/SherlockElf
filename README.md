## Features ‚ú®

- **Static Analysis**: Extracts and analyzes metadata, headers, and sections from ELF binaries.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Executes and monitors ELF binaries to observe runtime behavior and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive command-line interface for easy interaction.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed analysis reports for further inspection.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works seamlessly on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Usage üöÄ

Using SherlockElf is straightforward. Below are some common commands and their descriptions:

- **Static Analysis**:
    ```bash
    python emulate.py
    ```
    This command performs a static analysis on the specified ELF binary and outputs the results.
<br><br>
- **Dynamic Analysis**:
    ```python
    with open("hook/mem.js") as f:
        script_code = f.read()

    device, session = Inject(target=target).attach()
    script = session.create_script(script_code)
    script.on('message', on_message)
    script.load()
    ```
    This command executes the ELF binary and monitors its memory behavior.
